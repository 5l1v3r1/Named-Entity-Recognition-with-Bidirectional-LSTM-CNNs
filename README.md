# Named-Entity-Recognition-with-Bidirectional-LSTM-CNNs
  A keras implementation of Bidirectional-LSTM_CNNs for Named-Entity-Recoganition. The original paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08308

The implementation differs from the original paper in the following ways :
  1) lexicons are not considered
